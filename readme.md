# üåø Temple Solid Waste Management Portal - CSMC üåø

## Chhatrapati Sambhajinagar Municipal Corporation

### Project Overview
This repository contains the source code for the Temple Solid Waste Management (SWM) information portal, developed for the Solid Waste Management Department of Chhatrapati Sambhajinagar Municipal Corporation (CSMC).

The primary goal of this portal is to serve as the landing page when a **QR code** is scanned at a temple site, providing instant access to collection schedules, contact information, and awareness material. The initiative aims to streamline the collection of *Nirmalya* (temple offerings like flowers, leaves, and food), promote eco-friendly disposal through composting, and provide key information to the community.

## ‚ú® Key Features & Functionality

* **QR Code Landing Page:** Designed specifically to be the immediate source of information when a temple's SWM QR code is scanned.
* **Bilingual Support (English/Marathi):** Fully accessible content in both languages via a simple toggle.
* **Dynamic Text Sizing:** Users can increase or decrease the text size for improved readability.
* **Clear Contact Information:** Provides contact details for the **designated SWM vehicle driver** responsible for the local nirmalya collection route.
* **Eco-Initiative Awareness:** Dedicated section highlighting the composting process and environmental commitment.
* **Responsive Design:** Optimized for seamless viewing on desktop, tablet, and mobile devices.
