### Project Overview
This repository contains the source code for the Temple Solid Waste Management (SWM) information portal, developed for the Solid Waste Management Department of Chhatrapati Sambhajinagar Municipal Corporation (CSMC).

The primary goal of this portal is to serve as the landing page when a **QR code** is scanned at a temple site, providing instant access to collection schedules, contact information, and awareness material. The initiative aims to streamline the collection of *Nirmalya* (temple offerings like flowers, leaves, and food), promote eco-friendly disposal through composting, and provide key information to the community.
